STP - This is the original IEEE 802.1D version (802.1D-1998 and earlier) that provides a loop-free topology in a network with redundant links. Also called a Common Spanning Tree (CST) assumes one spanning tree instance for the entire bridged network, regardless of the number of VLANs.
Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST+) is a Cisco enhancement of STP that provides a separate 802.1D spanning tree instance for each VLAN configured in the network. PVST+ supports PortFast, UplinkFast, BackboneFast, BPDU guard, BPDU filter, root guard, and loop guard.
Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) or IEEE 802.1w is an evolution of STP that provides faster convergence than STP.
Rapid PVST+: This Cisco enhancement of RSTP uses PVST+ and provides a separate instance of 802.1w per VLAN. Each model supports PortFast, BPDU guard, BPDU filter, root guard, and loop guard.
Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) is an IEEE standard inspired by the earlier Cisco proprietary Multiple Instance STP (MISTP) implementation. MSTP maps multiple VLANs into the same spanning tree instance.
Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) is the Cisco implementation of MSTP, which provides up to 16 instances of RSTP and combines many VLANs with the same physical and logical topology into a typical RSTP instance. Each model supports PortFast, BPDU guard, BPDU filter, root guard, and loop guard.
